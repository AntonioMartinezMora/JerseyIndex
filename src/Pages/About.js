      <h2>About JerseySociety</h2>
      <p>
        Jersey Society was fathered into the internet world in 2022.<br/> The idea was simple, to keep track of all NBA Jerseys launched by Nike since 2017 when the swoosh company became the apparel provider for the NBA.<br/>
        In these years there have been numerous jersey releases with different editions and names and <i> Jersey Society </i>has been created to help you keep track of all of them.<br/>
